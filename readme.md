# FizzBuzz

Statement of the FizzBuzz problem:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

This repository uses Swift, C, and maybe other languages to try various solutions for FizzBuzz. Generally people say they get points for originality (using an esoteric language feature), brevity (smallest possible code), or performance.

Notably, FizzBuzz is often used in technical interviews to see if people can simply reason about the problem, and write working code. This could simply be writing `if` statements in a loop. But beyond that basic use, it is a fun coding playground.


### Xcode Project

Note that only `main.swift` is made a member of the default Xcode target. Xcode won't try to build and run the C code, for example. The files are included just to make it easier to use Xcode as the code editor for any of the samples.


## Origins
