# FizzBuzz

Using Swift, C, and maybe other languages to try out solutions for FizzBuzz. Will try a couple different versions just to play with the language features.


### Xcode Project

Note that only `main.swift` is made a member of the default Xcode target. Xcode won't try to build and run the C code, for example. The files are included just to make it easier to use Xcode as the code editor for any of the samples.


## Origins

Here are a couple articles online about the history of FizzBuzz:
